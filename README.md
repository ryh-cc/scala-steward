# Scala Steward

[Scala Steward](https://github.com/fthomas/scala-steward) is a bot that helps you keep library dependencies and sbt plugins up-to-date.

## Scala Steward Chart

This repository contains the scala steward chart that was created by
[garnercorp](https://www.garnercorp.com/#!/). As this is not maintained by the
creators anymore it has been forked and will be maintained by currencycloud
devs.

For instructions on how to install the chart see the `README` file inside the
`charts` folder.
